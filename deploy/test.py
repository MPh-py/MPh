"""
Runs all tests in the intended order.

This script does not run the tests via pyTest, but just executes the
test scripts as is, in a subprocess. (pyTest is however needed for some
test fixtures, so it must be installed.) We impose the intended order,
from the most basic functionality to the high-level abstractions.

Pass 'log' as a command-line argument to have the scripts print log
messages to the console while the tests are running. Pass 'debug' to
increase the verbosity of the log.
