    Starts a local Comsol session.

    This convenience function provides for the typical use case of
    running a Comsol session on the local machine, i.e. *not* have a
    client connect to a remote server elsewhere on the network.

    Example usage:
    ```python
    import mph
    client = mph.start(cores=1)
    model = client.load('model.mph')
    model.solve()
    model.save()
    client.remove(model)
    ```

    Depending on the platform, this may either be a stand-alone client
    (on Windows) or a thin client connected to a server running locally
    (on Linux and macOS). The reason for this disparity is that, while
    stand-alone clients are more lightweight and start up much faster,
    support for this mode of operation is limited on Unix-like operating
    systems, and thus not the default. Find more details in chapter
    "[Limitations](limitations.md#platform-differences)".

    Returns a {class}`Client` instance. Only one client can be
    instantiated at a time. Subsequent calls to `start()` will return
    the client instance created in the first call. In order to work
    around this limitation of the Comsol API, separate Python processes
    have to be started. Refer to section "[Multiple
    processes](demonstrations.md#multiple-processes)" for guidance.

    The number of `cores` (threads) the Comsol instance uses can be
    restricted by specifying a number. Otherwise all available cores
    will be used.

    A specific Comsol `version` can be selected if several are
    installed, for example `version='5.3a'`. Otherwise the latest
    version is used.

    The server `port` can be specified if client–server mode is used.
    If omitted, the server chooses a random free port.
