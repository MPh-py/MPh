class Server:
    """
    Manages a Comsol server process.

    Instances of this class start and eventually stop Comsol servers
    running on the local machine. Clients, either running on the same
    machine or elsewhere on the network, can then connect to the
    server at the network port it exposes for that purpose.

    Example usage:
    ```python
    import mph
    server = mph.Server(cores=1)
    print(f'Server listing on port {server.port}.')
    server.stop()
    ```

    The number of processor `cores` the server makes use of may be
    restricted. If no number is given, all cores are used by default.

    A specific `version` of the Comsol back-end can be specified if
    several are installed on the machine, for example `version='5.3a'`.
    Otherwise the latest version is used.

    The server can be instructed to use a specific network `port` for
    communication with clients by passing the number of a free port
    explicitly. If `port=None`, the default, the server will try to
    use port 2036 or, in case it is blocked by another server already
    running, will try subsequent numbers until it finds a free port.
    This is also Comsol's default behavior. It is however not robust
    and may lead to start-up failures if multiple servers are spinning
    up at the same time. Pass `port=0` to work around this issue. The
    server will then select a random free port, which will almost always
    avoid collisions.

    If `multi` is `False` or `'off'` or `None` (the default), then
    the server will shut down as soon as the first connected clients
    disconnects itself. If it is `True` or `'on'`, the server process
    will stay alive and accept multiple client connections.

    A `timeout` can be set for the server start-up. The default is 60
    seconds. `TimeoutError` is raised if the server failed to start
    within that period.
