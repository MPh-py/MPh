"""
Discovers Comsol installations.

This is an internal helper module that is not part of the public API. It
retrieves information about installed Comsol versions, i.e. available
simulation back-ends, and locates the installation folders.

On Windows, the discovery mechanism relies on the Registry to provide
information about install locations. On Linux and macOS, Comsol is expected to
be installed at its respective default location. Though the folder `.local` in
the user's home directory is also searched to allow symbolic linking to a
custom location.

Additionally, we also run the shell command `where comsol` (on Windows) or
`which comsol` (on Linux and macOS) to find a Comsol installation that isn't in
a default location, but for which the Comsol executable was added to the
executable search path.

Note that duplicate installations will be ignored. That is, a Comsol
installation found in a later step that reports the same version as one found
in an earlier step will be ignored, regardless of install location. The one
found on the search path, if any, will be prioritized.
