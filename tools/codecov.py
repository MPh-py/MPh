"""
Uploads the coverage report to CodeCov.

The script expects the CodeCov uploader to be installed locally. On
Windows, for example, `codecov.exe` would have to be on the search path.
It also expects the CodeCov upload token for this project to be set as
an environment variable.

CodeCov does not accept Coverage.py's standard report format, i.e. the
`.coverage` file. It must be converted to XML format beforehand.
