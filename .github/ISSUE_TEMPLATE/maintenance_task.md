<!--
A maintenance task is something like running the test suite with a Comsol version that has been newly released. Or fixing the tests to make them pass with that new Comsol release. Or updating the documentation accordingly. Or anything else intended to maintain the status quo.

Please don't suggest maintenance tasks for others to do unless you have previously taken care of such things yourself. But feel free to make others aware of maintenance that you plan to handle on your own.
