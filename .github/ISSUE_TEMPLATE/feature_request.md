about: Suggest a new feature you want to contribute.

<!--
A new feature is a function/method to be added to the library. Something new that would appear in the "API" chapter of the documentation:
https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html
Or an extension of the behavior of an existing API method/function.

Describe the feature you want to implement. Ideally, use the demonstration model from the Tutorial (capacitor.mph) to showcase it. You can attach a model file to your post, though you may have to "zip" it or change its file extension for the upload to go through.

Please note that this library is being actively maintained, but not actively developed. It's best to only suggest features that you're planning to contribute yourself.
