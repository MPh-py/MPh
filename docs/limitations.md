# Limitations

## Java bridge

MPh is built on top of the Python-to-Java bridge [JPype][jpype]. It is
JPype that allows us to look at Comsol's [Programming Manual][manual]
or its [API reference][api] and run the same commands from Python. All
credit to the JPype developers for making this possible.

Unfortunately, the Comsol API does not support running more than one
client at a time, i.e. within the same Java program. Meanwhile, JPype
cannot manage more than one Java virtual machine within the same Python
process. If it could, it would be easy to work around Comsol's limitation.
(There is an alternative Java bridge, [pyJNIus][jnius], which is not
limited to one virtual machine, but then fails in another regard: A number
of Java methods exposed by Comsol are inexplicably missing from the Python
encapsulation.)

Therefore, if several simulations are to be run in parallel, distributed
over independent processor cores in an effort to achieve maximum speed-up
of a parameter sweep, they have to be started as separate Python
subprocesses. Refer to section ["Multiple
processes"](demonstrations.md#multiple-processes) for a demonstration.

Additionally, there are some known, but unresolved issues with JPype's
shutdown of the Java virtual machine. Notably, pressing <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>
to interrupt an ongoing operation will usually crash the Python session.
So do not rely on catching [`KeyboardInterrupt`](python:KeyboardInterrupt)
exceptions in application code.


## Platform differences

The Comsol API offers two distinct ways to run a simulation session on
the local machine. We can either start a "stand-alone" client, which
does not require a Comsol server. Or we first start a server and then
have a "thin" client connect to it via a loop-back network socket. The
first approach is more lightweight and more reliable, as it keeps
everything inside the same process. The second approach is slower to
start up and relies on the inter-process communication to be robust,
but would also work across the network, i.e., for remote sessions where
the client runs locally and delegates the heavy lifting to a server
running on another machine. If we instantiate the [`Client`](mph.Client)
class without providing a value for the network port, it will create a
stand-alone client. Otherwise it will run as a thin client in
client–server mode.

On Linux and macOS, however, the stand-alone mode does not work out of
the box. This is due to a limitation of Unix-like operating systems
and explained in more detail in [GitHub issue #8][issue8]. On these
platforms, if all you did was install MPh, starting the client in
stand-alone mode will raise a `java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError` because
required external libraries cannot be found. You would have to add the
full paths of certain shared-library folders to an environment variable
named `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux and `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` on macOS.

For example, for an installation of Comsol 5.6 on Ubuntu Linux, you
would add the following lines at the end of the shell configuration
file `.bashrc`.
```shell
# Help MPh find Comsol's shared libraries.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:\
/usr/local/comsol56/multiphysics/lib/glnxa64:\
/usr/local/comsol56/multiphysics/ext/graphicsmagick/glnxa64:\
/usr/local/comsol56/multiphysics/ext/cadimport/glnxa64
```

On macOS, the root folder is `/Applications/COMSOL56/Multiphysics`.
The folder names depend on the installed Comsol version and will have
to be adapted accordingly.

Requiring the environment variable to be set correctly limits the
possibility of selecting a specific Comsol version from within MPh,
as adding multiple installations to that search path will lead to name
collisions. One could work around the issue by wrapping a Python program
using MPh in a shell script that sets the environment variable before
starting the Python process. That's effectively what Comsol itself does
to launch its GUI on one of these platforms. Or we could have a Python
program that sets the environment variable and then runs MPh in a second
Python subprocess. Clearly, none of this is ideal. Starting the client
should work without any of these detours.

The function [`mph.start()`](mph.start) exists to navigate these
platform differences. On Windows, it starts a stand-alone client in
order to profit from the better start-up performance. On Linux and
macOS, it creates a local session in client–server mode so that no
shell configuration is required up front. This behavior is reflected
in the configuration option `'session'`, accessible via
[`mph.option()`](mph.config), which is set to `'platform-dependent'`
by default. It could also be set to `'stand-alone'` or `'client-server'`
before calling `start()` in order to override the default behavior.

Performance in client–server mode is noticeably worse in certain
scenarios, not just at start-up. If functions access the Java API
frequently, such as when navigating the model tree, perhaps even
recursively as [`mph.tree()`](mph.tree) does, then client–server
mode can be slower by a large factor compared to a stand-alone client.
Rest assured however that simulation run-times are not affected.

Conversely, setting up stand-alone mode on Linux or macOS is also
not a robust solution. Image exports, for example, are known to crash
due to some conflict with external libraries. As opposed to Windows,
where this works reliably.
