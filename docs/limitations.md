# Limitations

## Java bridge

MPh is built on top of the Python-to-Java bridge [JPype]. It is JPype that
allows us to look at Comsol's [Programming Manual] or its [API reference] and
run the same commands from Python.

Unfortunately, the Comsol API does not support running more than one client at
a time, i.e. within the same Java program. Meanwhile, JPype cannot manage more
than one Java virtual machine within the same Python process. If it could, it
would be easy to work around Comsol's limitation. (There is an alternative Java
bridge, [pyJNIus], which is not limited to one virtual machine, but then fails
in another regard: A number of Java methods exposed by Comsol are inexplicably
missing from the Python encapsulation.)

Therefore, if several simulations are to be run in parallel, distributed over
independent processor cores in an effort to achieve maximum speed-up of a
parameter sweep, they have to be started as separate Python subprocesses. Refer
to section ["Multiple processes"](demonstrations.md#multiple-processes) for a
demonstration.

Additionally, there are some known, but unresolved issues with JPype's shutdown
of the Java virtual machine. Notably, pressing <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to interrupt
an ongoing operation will usually crash the Python session. So do not rely on
catching [`KeyboardInterrupt`](#KeyboardInterrupt) exceptions in application
code.


## Platform differences

The Comsol API offers two distinct ways to run a simulation session on the
local machine. We can either start a "stand-alone" client, which does not
require a Comsol server. Or we first start a server and then have a "thin"
client connect to it via a loop-back network socket. The first approach is more
lightweight and more reliable, especially on Windows, as it keeps everything
inside the same process. The second approach is slower to start up and relies
on the inter-process communication to be robust, but would also work across the
network, i.e., for remote sessions where the client runs locally and delegates
the heavy lifting to a server running on another machine. If we instantiate the
[`Client`](#Client) class without providing a value for the network port, it
will create a stand-alone client. Otherwise it will run as a thin client in
client–server mode.

On Linux and macOS, however, the stand-alone mode does not work out of the box.
This is due to a limitation of Unix-like operating systems and explained in
more detail in [GitHub issue #8]. On these platforms, if all you did was
install MPh, starting the client in stand-alone mode will raise a
`java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError` because required external libraries cannot be
found. You would have to add the full paths of certain shared-library folders
to an environment variable named `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux and
`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` on macOS.

For example, for an installation of Comsol 6.3 on Linux, you would add the
following lines at the end of the shell configuration file `.bashrc`.
```shell
# Help MPh find Comsol's shared libraries.
ComsolDir=/usr/local/comsol63/multiphysics
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\
$ComsolDir/lib/glnxa64:\
$ComsolDir/lib/glnxa64/gcc:\
$ComsolDir/ext/graphicsmagick/glnxa64:\
$ComsolDir/ext/cadimport/glnxa64:\
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

On macOS, `ComsolDir` would be `/Applications/COMSOL63/Multiphysics`. The above
is [as documented for Comsol 6.3][comsol63_libpath] — make sure to consult the
corresponding documentation for your Comsol version.

Requiring the environment variable to be set correctly limits the possibility
of selecting a specific Comsol version from within MPh, as adding multiple
installations to that search path will lead to name collisions. One could work
around the issue by wrapping a Python program using MPh in a shell script that
sets the environment variable before starting the Python process. That's
effectively what Comsol itself does to launch its GUI on one of these
platforms. Or we could have a Python program that sets the environment variable
and then runs MPh in a second Python subprocess. Clearly, none of this is
ideal. Starting the client should work without any of these detours.

The function [`mph.start()`](#start) exists to mitigate these platform
differences. On Windows, it starts a stand-alone client in order to profit from
the better start-up performance. On Linux and macOS, it creates a local session
in client–server mode so that no shell configuration is required up front. This
behavior is reflected in the configuration option `'session'`, accessible via
[`mph.option()`](#option), which is set to `'platform-dependent'` by default.
It could also be set to `'stand-alone'` or `'client-server'` before calling
`start()` in order to override the default behavior.

Performance in client–server mode is noticeably worse in certain scenarios, not
just at start-up. If functions access the Java API frequently, such as when
navigating the model tree, perhaps even recursively as [`mph.tree()`](#tree)
does, then client–server mode can be slower by a large factor compared to a
stand-alone client. Rest assured however that simulation run-times are not
affected.

Conversely, setting up stand-alone mode on Linux or macOS is also not a robust
solution. Image exports, for example, are known to crash due to some conflict
with external libraries. As opposed to Windows, where this works reliably.
