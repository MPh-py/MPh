# Releases

## 1.0.4
* Added missing support for installations with classkit license. ([#40](https://github.com/MPh-py/MPh/pull/40))
* Added name validation of available configuration options. ([#40](https://github.com/MPh-py/MPh/pull/40))
* Added support for persistent configuration storage to [`mph.config`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.config.html).
* Fixed: No preference `checkforrecoveries` on certain installations. ([#39](https://github.com/MPh-py/MPh/issues/39))
* Fixed: Unclear error message when requested version is not installed. ([#42](https://github.com/MPh-py/MPh/issues/42))

## 1.0.3
* [Published](https://pypi.org/project/MPh/1.0.3) on May 5, 2021.
* Fixes: [`Client.remove()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Client.html#mph.Client.remove) did not accept model by name.
* Fixes: Node names were not escaped when creating new features.
* Fixes: [`Model.save()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.save) failed when `format` given, but not `path`.
* Fixes: [`Model.save()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.save) without `path` given did not save new models.
* Fixes: [`Model.parameters(evaluate=True)`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.parameters) returned strings, not numbers.
* Fixes off-by-one error when passing `inner` indices to [`Model.evaluate()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.evaluate).
* Comsol expects 1-based indices, as opposed to Python's 0-based indexing.
* Adds missing built-in group `'couplings'`.
* [`mph.start()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.start.html) now returns existing client instance on subsequent calls.

## 1.0.2
* [Published](https://pypi.org/project/MPh/1.0.2) on April 28, 2021.
* Assigns more typical tag names when creating new model features.
* In most cases, tags are now named like they are in the Comsol GUI.
* [`Node.retag()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Node.html#mph.Node.retag) allows post-hoc modification of a node's tag.
* Adds missing built-in groups, e.g. evaluations and tables.
* Improves performance of node navigation in client–server mode.
* The internal type-casting converts [`Node`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Node.html) instances to their tags.
* The internal type-casting handles lists of numbers.
* Before, [`property()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Node.html#mph.Node.property) and [`create()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Node.html#mph.Node.create) would only accept lists of strings.
* [`Node.type()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Node.html#mph.Node.type) now returns nothing if node has no feature type.
* Moved tutorial model to [`demos`](https://github.com/MPh-py/MPh/tree/main/demos) folder.
* Added demo script [`create_capacitor.py`](https://github.com/MPh-py/MPh/blob/main/demos/create_capacitor.py) that generates the tutorial model.

## 1.0.1
* [Published](https://pypi.org/project/MPh/1.0.1) on April 23, 2021.
* Fixes failing evaluation when name of default dataset contains slash.
* Fixes failing evaluation of complex-valued expressions.
* Fixes issue with complex numbers in parameter assignments. ([#36](https://github.com/MPh-py/MPh/issues/36))

## 1.0.0
* [Published](https://pypi.org/project/MPh/1.0.0) on April 13, 2021.
* We now offer you the best API Comsol has ever seen! 🎉
* See ["Creating models: Python style"](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/demonstrations.html#creating-models-python-style) for a feature demonstration.
* A new [`Node`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Node.html) class allows easy navigation of the model tree.
* The [`Model`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Model.html) class relies internally on `Node` for most functionality.
* Feature nodes can be created with [`Model.create()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.create).
* Node properties can be read and written via [`Model.property()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.property).
* Feature nodes can be removed with [`Model.remove()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.remove).
* The [`Node`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Node.html) class has additional functionality for modifying the model.
* All feature nodes can now be [toggled](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Node.html#mph.Node.toggle), not just physics features.
* [`Model.features()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.features) and [`Model.toggle()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.toggle) have been deprecated.
* Use the [`Node`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Node.html) class instead to access that functionality.
* [`Model.import_()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.import_) was introduced to supersede [`Model.load()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.load).
* Arguments `unit` and `description` to [`Model.parameter()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.parameter) are deprecated.
* Parameter descriptions should now be accessed via [`Model.description()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.description).
* [`Model.parameters()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.parameters) now returns a dictionary [instead of named tuples](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.parameters).
* This is a breaking change, but in line with other parts of the API.
* [`mph.start()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.start.html) now picks a random free server port in client-server mode.
* This avoids collisions when starting multiple processes on Linux and macOS.
* Models may be [saved as](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.save) Java, Matlab, or VBA source files.
* [`mph.tree()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/api/mph.tree.html) helps developers inspect the model tree in the console.
* Known issue: Navigating the model tree is slow in client–server mode.
* It is much faster in stand-alone mode, the default on Windows.
* Made folder search case-insensitive on Linux/macOS, as requested in [#31](https://github.com/MPh-py/MPh/issues/31).
* Documentation builds now use the [MyST parser](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser) and the [Furo theme](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo).

## 0.9.1
* [Published](https://pypi.org/project/MPh/0.9.1) on March 24, 2021.
* Added documentation chapter ["Demonstrations"](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/demonstrations.html).
* Added [demo script](https://github.com/MPh-py/MPh/blob/72624ea6d92f009af07b3c7468084ab2a62dccfb/demos/worker_pool.py) that runs parallel Comsol sessions.
* Amended [`mph.start()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.start.html#mph.start) to allow hand-selecting the server port.
* This makes the demo script work reliably on Linux and macOS.
* Improved error handling at [server](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.Server.html#mph.Server) start-up.
* Relaxed log levels during [discovery](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.discovery.html) of Comsol installations.
* This suppresses possibly confusing log messages as described in [#28](https://github.com/MPh-py/MPh/issues/28).

## 0.9.0
* [Published](https://pypi.org/project/MPh/0.9.0) on March 10, 2021.
* [`mph.start()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.start.html) is now the preferred way to start a local Comsol session.
* On Windows, it starts a lightweight, stand-alone client.
* On Linux and macOS, it starts a thin client and local server.
* This is due to limitations on these platforms described in [issue #8](https://github.com/MPh-py/MPh/issues/8).
* Configuration options are exposed by [`mph.option()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.config.html#mph.config.option).
* An in-memory [cache](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.Client.html#mph.Client.caching) for previously loaded model files may be activated.
* Selection names are returned by [`model.selections()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.selections).
* Feature names in physics interfaces are returned by [`model.features()`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.features).
* Feature nodes in physics interfaces can be [toggled](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.toggle) on or off.
* [Parameter](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.parameter) descriptions can be modified.
* [Parameter](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model.parameter) values may be returned as evaluated numbers instead of string expressions.
* Custom classes derived from [`Model`](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.Model.html#mph.Model) can now be more easily type-cast to.
* Users are warned if log-in details for the Comsol [server](https://mph.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/api/mph.Server.html#mph.Server) have not been set up.
* Fixes [issue #23](https://github.com/MPh-py/MPh/issues/23) regarding discovery with older Python versions on Windows.
* Fixes [issue #24](https://github.com/MPh-py/MPh/issues/24) regarding localized server output messages.
