# Demonstrations

## Busbar example

["Electrical Heating in a Busbar"][busbar] is an example model featured
in the tutorial of ["Introduction to Comsol Multiphysics"][intro] and
explained there in great detail. The section "Getting the Maximum and
Minimum Temperature" demonstrates how to obtain the two temperature
extremes within the Comsol GUI.

The following Python code does the same thing programmatically:
```python
import mph

client = mph.start()
model = client.load('busbar.mph')
model.solve()

(x, y, z, T) = model.evaluate(['x', 'y', 'z', 'T'])
(Tmax, Tmin) = (T.max(), T.min())
(imax, imin) = (T.argmax(), T.argmin())
print(f'Tmax = {T.max():.2f} K at ({x[imax]:5f}, {y[imax]:5f}, {z[imax]:5f})')
print(f'Tmin = {T.min():.2f} K at ({x[imin]:5f}, {y[imin]:5f}, {z[imin]:5f})')
```

This outputs the exact same numbers that appear in the table of the GUI:
```none
Tmax = 330.42 K at (0.105000, -0.024899, 0.053425)
Tmin = 322.41 K at (0.063272, 0.000000, 0.000000)
```

We could now sweep the model's parameters, for example the length `L`
or width `wbb` of the busbar.


## Compacting models

We usually save models to disk after we have solved them, which
includes the solution and mesh data in the file. This is convenient
so that we can come back to the model later, but don't have to run
the simulation again, which may take a long time. However, the files
then require a lot of disk space. After a while, we may want to archive
the models, but trim the fat before we do that.

To compact all model files in the current working directory, we can
do this:
```python
import mph
from pathlib import Path

client = mph.start()
for file in Path.cwd().glob('*.mph'):
    print(f'{file}:')
    model = client.load(file)
    model.clear()
    model.save()
```

The script [`compact_models.py`][compact] in the `demos` folder of the
source-code repository is a refined version of the above code. It
displays more status information and also resets the modeling history.

Note that we could easily go through all sub-directories recursively
by replacing [`glob`](python:pathlib.Path.glob) with
[`rglob`](python:pathlib.Path.rglob). However, this should be used
with caution so as to not accidentally modify models in folders that
were not meant to be included.


## Multiple processes

As explained in [Limitations](limitations), we cannot run more than
one Comsol session inside the same Python process. But we *can* start
multiple Python processes in parallel if we leverage the
[`multiprocessing`](python:multiprocessing) module from the standard
library.
```python
import mph
import multiprocessing
import queue
```

Additionally, we have imported the [`queue`](python:queue) module, also
from the standard library, though only for the [`queue.Empty`](
python:queue.Empty) exception type that it provides.

In this demonstration, we will solve the model [`capacitor.mph`][capa]
from the [Tutorial](tutorial). We want to sweep the electrode distance
*d* and calculate the capacitance *C* for each value of the distance,
ranging from 0.5 to 5 mm.
```python
values = [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0]
```

Next, we define the function that we intend to run in every process,
i.e. the "worker". The function sets up the Comsol session when the
process starts, then keeps solving the model for every distance value
that it receives via a `jobs` queue. Each time, it evaluates the
solution and returns the capacitance via a `results` queue. It does
so until the `jobs` queue is exhausted, upon which the function
terminates, and with it Comsol session and Python process.
```python
def worker(jobs, results):
    client = mph.start(cores=1)
    model = client.load('capacitor.mph')
    while True:
        try:
            d = jobs.get(block=False)
        except queue.Empty:
            break
        model.parameter('d', f'{d} [mm]')
        model.solve('static')
        C = model.evaluate('2*es.intWe/U^2', 'pF')
        results.put((d, C))
```

Each worker will only use one of the processor cores available on the
machine, as that's the whole point: We want to achieve maximum speed-up
of, say, a parameter sweep, by having each core work on a job
corresponding to one of the many parameter values, which it can do
independently of work being done for any other value.

We could also solve this sequentially, one parameter value at a time.
Comsol's solver could then make use of all cores and would also employ
some parallelization strategy in its internal computation. But the
speed-up would not scale linearly with the number of cores, especially
for large numbers of them.

We might use a "parametric sweep", a feature that Comsol does offer.
But by doing this in Python we retain full programmatic control of
which parameter is solved for and when. The parameter values don't
have to be hard-coded, they could come from user input or be generated
depending on the outcome of previous simulations. For example, this
approach lends itself to iterative optimization schemes such as the
["genetic algorithm"][ga], where a batch of simulations would be run
for each new "generation".

Note how the returned results also contain the input parameter. As
the worker processes will run asynchronously in parallel, we cannot
take for granted that output is returned in input order.

Before we start the computation, we add all parameter values to the
`jobs` queue:
```python
jobs = multiprocessing.Queue()
for d in values:
    jobs.put(d)
```

We also have to provide the `results` queue, which is of course empty
at first.
```python
results = multiprocessing.Queue()
```

Then we can start a number of workers, say four:
```python
for _ in range(4):
    process = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(jobs, results))
    process.start()
```

It may be a good idea to hold on to the `process` objects and add them
to a list `processes`, just so that Python's garbage collection won't
accidentally delete them while the external processes are running.

Finally, still in the main process that starts all the workers, we can
collect the results. We use a `for` loop and exploit the fact that
there will be as many results as there were jobs to begin with.
```python
for _ in values:
    (d, C) = results.get()
```

We would then display them, plot them, save them to a file, or whatever
it is we do with simulation results.

The complete script [`worker_pool.py`][pool], which implements all of
the above and also irons out some wrinkles not covered here for the
sake of brevity, can be found in the `demos` folder of the source-code
repository. As it runs, it displays a live plot such as the one that
follows. It is reproduced here preserving the real time from a run with
two workers. Observe how the first two data points do in fact come in
out of order.

```{image} images/worker_pool.gif
:alt: Live plot of worker pool demo
:align: center
```

A more advanced implementation may use a class derived from
[`multiprocessing.Process`](python:multiprocessing.Process) instead
of a mere function, just to be able to save state. For long-running
simulations it would make sense to store jobs and results on disk,
rather than in memory, so that the execution of the queue may be resumed
after a possible interruption. In that case one may, or may not, find
the [`subprocess`](python:subprocess) module more convenient for starting
the external processes. The worker implementation would then be in a
separate module that is run as a script.


## Access the full Comsol API

The primary focus of MPh is to automate the simulation workflow, like
running parameter sweeps or optimization routines with customized,
Python-powered post-processing. Navigating and altering models is
possible, see [next section](#navigate-and-alter-the-model), but has
some limitations.

However, any and all functionality offered by the [Comsol API][proman]
is accessible via the "pythonized" Java layer provided by [JPype],
which is exposed as the `.java` attribute of [`Client`](mph.Client)
instances, mapping to Comsol's [`ModelUtil`], as well as of
[`Model`](mph.Model) instances, mapping to Comsol's [`model`].

Let's take this Comsol blog post as an example: ["Automate your modeling
tasks with the Comsol API for use with Java"][blog]. It starts with the
following Java code:
```java
import com.comsol.model.*;
import com.comsol.model.util.*;

public class HelloWorld {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      run();
   }

   public static Model run() {
      Model model = ModelUtil.create("Model");
      model.modelNode().create("comp1");
      model.geom().create("geom1", 3);
      model.geom("geom1").feature().create("blk1", "Block");
      model.geom("geom1").feature("blk1").set("size", new String[]{"0.1", "0.2", "0.5"});
      model.geom("geom1").run("fin");
      return model;
   }
}
```

What it does is, it creates a model, which contains a 3d geometry
component that is just a block 0.1 by 0.2 by 0.5 meters in size.

In Python, we would achieve the same like so:
```python
import mph

client = mph.start()
pymodel = client.create('Model')
model = pymodel.java

model.modelNode().create("comp1");
model.geom().create("geom1", 3);
model.geom("geom1").feature().create("blk1", "Block");
model.geom("geom1").feature("blk1").set("size", ["0.1", "0.2", "0.5"]);
model.geom("geom1").run("fin");
```

Note how the *functional* Java code (excluding the Java boilerplate)
was essentially copied and pasted, even the semicolons, which Python
simply ignores. We named the Python wrapper `pymodel` and assigned
`model` to the underlying Java object just so we could do this. We had
to replace `new String[]{"0.1", "0.2", "0.5"}` because Python does not
know what [`new`][new] means. There, Java expects a list of three
strings. So we replaced the expression with `["0.1", "0.2", "0.5"]`,
the Python equivalent of just that: a list of these three strings.

Occasionally when translating Java (or Matlab) code you find in the
documentation, or a blog post as the case was here, you will have to
amend code lines such as the one above. But they are few and far between.
The error messages you might receive should point you in the right
direction and the [JPype] documentation would offer help on issues with
type conversion.

The advantage of using Python over Java is:
* You don't really need to know Java. Just a little, to understand that
  occasionally we have to take care of type conversions that JPype
  cannot handle all by itself. Which is rare.
* You don't need to install Java. It just ships with Comsol. You also
  don't need to bother with compiling Java source code to Java classes
  via `comsolcompile`.
* You can use Python introspection to understand how Comsol models
  are "created in code". The Comsol documentation explains a lot of
  things, but not every little detail. Either use Python's built-in
  [`dir()`](python:dir) or call [`mph.inspect()`](mph.inspect) to see
  a pretty-fied representation of a Java object in the model tree.

To save the model created in the above example, we do:
```python
pymodel.save('model')
```

This stores a file named `model.mph` in the working directory, which
may then be opened in the Comsol GUI or be used in any other Python,
Java, or Matlab project.

Comsol can be very helpful in creating the Java code corresponding to
changes we make to a model. Not only does the GUI provide a function to
"copy as code to clipboard" on any node, it also lets us save the entire
model as Java source code. And if we "compact the history" right before
making changes, the new code can conveniently be found at the very end
of the Java file.


## Navigate and alter the model

The example from the previous section can be expressed in much more
idiomatic Python syntax if we ignore the Java layer and only use
methods from the [`Model`](mph.Model) class.
```python
import mph
client = mph.start()
model = client.create()
model.create('geometries', 3)
model.create('geometries/Geometry 1', 'Block')
model.property('geometries/Geometry 1/Block 1', 'size', ('0.1', '0.2', '0.5'))
model.build('Geometry 1')
```

This, again, hides all tags in application code. Instead, we refer to
nodes in the model tree by name. In the example, these names were
generated automatically, in the same way the Comsol GUI does it. We
could also supply names of our choosing.
```python
import mph
client = mph.start()
model = client.create('block of ice')
model.create('geometries/geometry', 3)
model.create('geometries/geometry/ice block', 'Block')
model.property('geometries/geometry/ice block', 'size', ('0.1', '0.2', '0.5'))
model.build('geometry')
```

If [`model.create()`](mph.Model) receives a reference to a node that
does not exist yet, such as `geometries/geometry` in the example, it
creates that node in its parent group, here the built-in group
`geometries`, and gives it the name we supplied, here `geometry`.

So far, we have used strings to refer to nodes. We could also use the
[`Node`](mph.Node) class, which offers more flexibility and extra
functionality. Instances of that class are returned by `model.create()`
for convenience. But they can be generated from scratch by string
concatenation with the division operator — much like
[`pathlib.Path`](python:pathlib.Path) objects from Python's standard
library.
```python
import mph
client = mph.start()
model = client.create('block of ice')
geometries = model/'geometries'
geometry = geometries.create(3, name='geometry')
block = geometry.create('Block', name='ice block')
block.property('size', ('0.1', '0.2', '0.5'))
model.build(geometry)
```

The division operator is the Swiss army knife for accessing nodes in
the model tree. It even works with `client` as root. Within that last
example, the following notations
```python
client/'block of ice'/'geometries'/'geometry'/'ice block'
model/'geometries'/'geometry'/'ice block'
geometries/'geometry'/'ice block'
geometry/'ice block'
block
```

all refer to the same geometry element in the model. We could also
include the forward slash in a string expression instead of using it as
an operator, just like we did in the first and second example.
```python
model/'geometries/geometry/ice block'
```

The model's root node can be referenced with either `model/''` or
`model/None`. If any of the node names in the hierarchy contain a
forward slash themselves, that forward slash can be escaped (i.e.,
marked to be interpreted literally) by doubling it. For instance,
a geometry node displayed as "ice/frozen water" in the Comsol GUI
would be referred to as `geometry/'ice//frozen water'`.

The example model discussed here produces the following model
[tree](mph.tree):
```python
>>> mph.tree(model)
block of ice
├─ parameters
│  └─ Parameters 1
├─ functions
├─ components
│  └─ Component 1
├─ geometries
│  └─ geometry
│     ├─ ice block
│     └─ Form Union
├─ views
│  └─ View 1
├─ selections
├─ coordinates
│  └─ Boundary System 1
├─ variables
├─ couplings
├─ physics
├─ multiphysics
├─ materials
├─ meshes
├─ studies
├─ solutions
├─ batches
├─ datasets
├─ evaluations
├─ tables
├─ plots
└─ exports
```

The parameter group, model component, default view and coordinate
system were created by Comsol automatically. We could rename these
nodes if we wanted to. Most built-in groups are still empty, waiting
for features to be created.

The demo script [`create_capacitor.py`][create] shows how to create
more advanced features than in the simple example here: It generates
the demonstration model used in the [Tutorial](tutorial).
