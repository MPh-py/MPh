# Credits

MPh leverages [JPype] to easily call Java code directly from Python. All credit
to the JPype developers for making that possible. This is what allows us to
retrieve results as [NumPy] arrays, the corner stone of the scientific Python
ecosystem.

For automated testing we rely on [pyTest] and [Coverage.py]. Code quality is
assured by [Ruff]. Packaging is handled by [Flit]. The documentation is
rendered by [Sphinx] using the [MyST] parser to process the Markdown input and
the [Furo] theme to style the HTML output.

Thanks to the [contributors] as well as anyone reporting [issues] and helping
to resolve them.
